### Quickstart

To set up your own instance of reddit to develop with, we have a handy [install script for Ubuntu](https://github.com/kevcarbone/flotag/wiki/flotag-install-script-for-Ubuntu) that will automatically install and configure most of the stack.


### APIs

To learn more about flotags's API, check out the [API wiki page](https://github.com/kevcarbone/flotag/wiki/API).

Happy hacking!
